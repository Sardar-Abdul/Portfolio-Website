                I build responsive<br /> websites for an optimal user experience that 
                 achieve your business goals.<br />
                I design and code simple things and I love what I do.
                I am quiet confident,<br /> naturally curious, 
                and perpetually working on improving my chops one design <br />problem at a time.
                I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and <br />thoughtful interactions.
                I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing <br />ideas to life in the browser.
                I enjoy building everything from small businesses to <br />rich interactive web pages. 
                Once the proper information architecture is in place,<br />
                 I design the visual layer to create a beautiful user experience.</p>
